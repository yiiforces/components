/**
 * Connection represents a connection to a database via [PDO](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php).
 *
 * Connection works together with [[Command]], [[DataReader]] and [[Transaction]]
 * to provide data access to various DBMS in a common set of APIs. They are a thin wrapper
 * of the [PDO PHP extension](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php).
 *
 * Connection supports database replication and read-write splitting. In particular, a Connection component
 * can be configured with multiple [[masters]] and [[slaves]]. It will do load balancing and failover by choosing
 * appropriate servers. It will also automatically direct read operations to the slaves and write operations to
 * the masters.
 *
 * To establish a DB connection, set [[dsn]], [[username]] and [[password]], and then
 * call [[open()]] to connect to the database server. The current state of the connection can be checked using [[$isActive]].
 *
 * The following example shows how to create a Connection instance and establish
 * the DB connection:
 *
 * ```php
 * $connection = new \yii\db\Connection([
 *     'dsn' => $dsn,
 *     'username' => $username,
 *     'password' => $password,
 * ]);
 * $connection->open();
 * ```
 *
 * After the DB connection is established, one can execute SQL statements like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * $command = $connection->createCommand('SELECT * FROM post');
 * $posts = $command->queryAll();
 * $command = $connection->createCommand('UPDATE post SET status=1');
 * $command->execute();
 * ```
 *
 * One can also do prepared SQL execution and bind parameters to the prepared SQL.
 * When the parameters are coming from user input, you should use this approach
 * to prevent SQL injection attacks. The following is an example:
 *
 * ```php
 * $command = $connection->createCommand('SELECT * FROM post WHERE id=:id');
 * $command->bindValue(':id', $_GET['id']);
 * $post = $command->query();
 * ```
 *
 * For more information about how to perform various DB queries, please refer to [[Command]].
 *
 * If the underlying DBMS supports transactions, you can perform transactional SQL queries
 * like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * $transaction = $connection->beginTransaction();
 * try {
 *     $connection->createCommand($sql1)->execute();
 *     $connection->createCommand($sql2)->execute();
 *     // ... executing other SQL statements ...
 *     $transaction->commit();
 * } catch (Exception $e) {
 *     $transaction->rollBack();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You also can use shortcut for the above like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * $connection->transaction(function () {
 *     $order = new Order($customer);
 *     $order->save();
 *     $order->addItems($items);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If needed you can pass transaction isolation level as a second parameter:
 *
 * ```php
 * $connection->transaction(function (Connection $db) {
 *     //return $db->...
 * }, Transaction::READ_UNCOMMITTED);
 * ```
 *
 * Connection is often used as an application component and configured in the application
 * configuration like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * 'components' => [
 *     'db' => [
 *         'class' => '\yii\db\Connection',
 *         'dsn' => 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=demo',
 *         'username' => 'root',
 *         'password' => '',
 *         'charset' => 'utf8',
 *     ],
 * ],
 * ```
 *
 * @property string $driverName Name of the DB driver.
 * @property bool $isActive Whether the DB connection is established. This property is read-only.
 * @property string $lastInsertID The row ID of the last row inserted, or the last value retrieved from the
 * sequence object. This property is read-only.
 * @property Connection $master The currently active master connection. `null` is returned if there is no
 * master available. This property is read-only.
 * @property PDO $masterPdo The PDO instance for the currently active master connection. This property is
 * read-only.
 * @property QueryBuilder $queryBuilder The query builder for the current DB connection. Note that the type of
 * this property differs in getter and setter. See [[getQueryBuilder()]] and [[setQueryBuilder()]] for details.
 * @property Schema $schema The schema information for the database opened by this connection. This property
 * is read-only.
 * @property string $serverVersion Server version as a string. This property is read-only.
 * @property Connection $slave The currently active slave connection. `null` is returned if there is no slave
 * available and `$fallbackToMaster` is false. This property is read-only.
 * @property PDO $slavePdo The PDO instance for the currently active slave connection. `null` is returned if
 * no slave connection is available and `$fallbackToMaster` is false. This property is read-only.
 * @property Transaction|null $transaction The currently active transaction. Null if no active transaction.
 * This property is read-only.
